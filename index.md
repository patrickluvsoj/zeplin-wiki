## Welcome to the Zeplin Onboarding Workbook!
We outline all the best practices and tips we've learned from the best teams, and share them here. You can copy/fork this repository to create a custom onboarding site for your team! Since it's in markdown, you can also simply copy and paste the content to other Wiki sites and it will work just fine too.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Project Naming Convention

Once you start using Zeplin, itâ€™s common to have hundreds of project. Establishing a naming convention enhances visibility of projects and discoverability.

*Naming:* use vocabulary thatâ€™s familiar to your team like team, group, platform, project, feature, epic name.
ex. Airbnb Experience-iOS-Check-out

*Thumbnail:* add a thumbnail to your project that makes it easy to distinguish platform type (Web, iOS, Android) or team.

### ex. Some teams color code thumbnails like this ðŸ‘‡

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/patrickluvsoj/blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
