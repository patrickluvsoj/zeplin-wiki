## Project Naming Convention

### Guide
Once you start using Zeplin, it‚Äôs common to have hundreds of project. Establishing a naming convention enhances visibility of projects and discoverability.

*Naming:* use vocabulary that‚Äôs familiar to your team like team, group, platform, project, feature, epic name.
ex. Airbnb Experience-iOS-Check-out

*Thumbnail:* add a thumbnail to your project that makes it easy to distinguish platform type (Web, iOS, Android) or team.

**ex. Some teams color code thumbnails like this üëá**
