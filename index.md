## Project Naming Convention

Once you start using Zeplin, itâ€™s common to have hundreds of project. Establishing a naming convention enhances visibility of projects and discoverability.

*Naming:* use vocabulary thatâ€™s familiar to your team like team, group, platform, project, feature, epic name.
ex. Airbnb Experience-iOS-Check-out

*Thumbnail:* add a thumbnail to your project that makes it easy to distinguish platform type (Web, iOS, Android) or team.

### ex. Some teams color code thumbnails like this ðŸ‘‡
