# Welcome to the Zeplin Onboarding Workbook! 🎉
We outline all the best practices and tips we've learned from the best teams, and share them here. You can copy/fork this repository to create a custom onboarding site for your team! Since it's in markdown, you can also simply copy and paste the content to other Wiki sites and it will work just fine too.


**Purpose:** we list out best practices that we’ve seen teams adopt to effectively collaborate. It’s meant to help standardize your team’s workflow and facilitate onboarding new team members.

**Customize:** this doc is a template and it’s meant to be customized based on your unique team setup and workflow. Feel free to take out any content that are not applicable to your team, and your own twist!

**Engineers:** we recommend teams to review this with at least one engineering lead to agree on workflows and best practices you document on this onboarding doc. Close collaboration with developers is key! 🔑
